## 1. Design System & UI Review

### Typography Analysis

**Current Typography Issues:**
- **Font Family**: Default system fonts with no custom typography strategy
- **Font Hierarchy**: Inconsistent heading structure (H1-H6 not properly implemented)
- **Font Sizes**: Limited range, primarily using browser defaults
- **Line Height**: Insufficient spacing for readability (1.2-1.4 observed, should be 1.5-1.6)
- **Font Weights**: Only regular (400) and bold (700) weights used

**Specific Findings:**
```
Primary Font: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto
Body Text Size: 16px (appropriate)
Line Height: 1.4 (insufficient for accessibility)
Letter Spacing: Default (needs optimization for headings)
```

**Typography Recommendations:**
1. Implement consistent font scale: 12px, 14px, 16px, 18px, 20px, 24px, 32px, 48px
2. Increase line-height to 1.6 for body text, 1.3 for headings
3. Add font-weight variations: 300 (light), 400 (regular), 500 (medium), 600 (semibold), 700 (bold)
4. Implement proper heading hierarchy with semantic HTML

### Layout & Spacing Issues

**Critical Layout Problems:**
- **Inconsistent Spacing**: Mixed use of 8px, 12px, 16px, 20px, 24px without systematic approach
- **Poor Grid System**: No consistent column structure
- **Inadequate Padding**: Components too tightly packed
- **Margin Inconsistencies**: Vertical rhythm disrupted

**Current Spacing Analysis:**
```
Card Padding: 16px (insufficient for enterprise content)
Button Padding: 8px 16px (too small for accessibility)
Section Margins: Inconsistent (12px-32px)
Grid Gaps: No consistent system
```

**Layout Recommendations:**
1. Implement 8px baseline grid system (8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64px)
2. Increase minimum touch target size to 44px x 44px
3. Standardize card padding to 24px minimum
4. Create consistent vertical rhythm with 24px baseline

### Color System & Visual Hierarchy

**Current Color Palette Issues:**
- **Limited Color Range**: Basic Material-UI defaults without customization
- **Poor Contrast Ratios**: Several combinations fail WCAG AA standards
- **No Semantic Colors**: Missing status indicators for different states

**Color Accessibility Issues:**
```
Primary Blue (#1976d2): Adequate contrast on white
Secondary Text (#666666): Fails WCAG AA (3.1:1 ratio, needs 4.5:1)
Success Green (#4caf50): Borderline contrast issues
Error Red (#f44336): Adequate but could be improved
```

**Color System Recommendations:**
1. Develop comprehensive color palette with 5-7 primary colors
2. Create semantic color system for status indicators
3. Ensure all color combinations meet WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 minimum)
4. Add dark mode support for enterprise users
